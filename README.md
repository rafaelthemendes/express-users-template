# Express Boilerplate - User authentication

Express boilerplate for a user authentication flow. In this project I used typescript and typeorm to connect to a postgres database. The architecture is based on SOLID principles.


### Requirements

```

node >= 8.3

yarn >= 1.19.1

```


### Setup
First of all, create a postgres database on localhost, with [these credentials](ormconfig.json)
Then, install the dependencies:
`npx yarn`


### Running project
`npx yarn dev:server`


### Tests
`npx yarn test`
